## I.	Introduction / Problem Statement
In the intricate web of the Philippine socio-economic landscape, the persistent challenge of poverty poses an obstacle, hindering the nation's path to comprehensive development. Despite commendable economic growth, poverty endures, characterized by low income, constrained employment opportunities, and limited access to essential services. 

Aligning itself with the global commitment encapsulated in the Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs), the Philippines underscores its dedication to fostering a more equitable society. Embracing the principles of SDG 1: "No Poverty," the nation recognizes the importance of eradicating all facets of poverty, ensuring that every individual has equal access to the essentials necessary for a dignified life.

In the fabric of a nation's economic landscape, one of the pivotal contributors is the rural economy, wielding both the potential for prosperity and the challenges of poverty. Rooted in the vast expanses beyond urban centers, the rural economy encompasses a diverse range of agricultural activities, non-farm enterprises, and local industries. Its significance extends far beyond the idyllic scenes of farmland, encompassing the livelihoods of a substantial portion of the population.
  
For the Philippines, rural economies is considered as the backbone of the agricultural sector, nurturing the cultivation of crops and the rearing of livestock that form the bedrock of food security. Beyond agriculture, these economies host a spectrum of non-farm activities, from small-scale enterprises to traditional crafts, creating a web of interconnected economic activities that sustains communities.

However, while the rural economy is a wellspring of economic contributions, it also grapples with the shadows of poverty. The challenges are manifold, encompassing factors such as limited access to resources, market fluctuations, and vulnerability to climate change. As a result, a significant proportion of the rural populace contends with lower income levels, constrained employment opportunities, and disparities in access to essential services. In relation to this, understanding the dynamics of the rural economy as a contributor to both economic growth and poverty is essential for crafting effective policies.

Income disparities in the rural economy serve as a testament to the pervasive hold of poverty, as a significant portion of the population remains below the national poverty line. Limited stable employment opportunities increase vulnerability, exposing individuals and families to a state of socio-economic instability. With these, a more in-depth analysis of these indicators, including rural income, agricultural wages, non-farm income, and employment, will be undertaken to glean a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to the issue of poverty for targeted and effective interventions to address the root causes and foster inclusive progress.

## II.	Gathered Data / Dataset 
The dataset employed in this project is a comprehensive compilation of economic and agricultural indicators, providing a detailed snapshot of the socio-economic insight across various regions in the Philippines. These indicators encompass a wide array of quantitative measures that capture the dimensions of economic and agricultural activities, shedding light on the characteristics and disparities that exist among different geographic areas within the country.

Titled "A Few Poverty Indicators for the Philippines by Region," the dataset has been sourced from Kaggle.com, with the last recorded update dating back to the year 2018. Kaggle is a renowned platform that hosts datasets and facilitates collaborative data science projects. This particular dataset serves as a valuable resource for understanding poverty dynamics in the Philippines, providing insights into various indicators across different regions of the country. The dataset is presented in Figure 3.
